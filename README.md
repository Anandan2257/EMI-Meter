## Arduino Code
```cpp
#include <ArduinoFFT.h>

// Constants
#define SAMPLES 64             // Must be a power of 2
#define SAMPLING_FREQUENCY 1000 // Hz

ArduinoFFT<double> FFT = ArduinoFFT<double>(); // FFT object

double vReal[SAMPLES]; // Real part
double vImag[SAMPLES]; // Imaginary part

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < SAMPLES; i++) {
    vReal[i] = analogRead(A0); // Replace A0 with the correct pin
    vImag[i] = 0;
    delayMicroseconds(1000000 / SAMPLING_FREQUENCY);
  }

  FFT.windowing(vReal, SAMPLES, FFT_WIN_TYP_HAMMING, FFT_FORWARD);
  FFT.compute(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES, FFT_FORWARD);
  FFT.complexToMagnitude(vReal, vImag, SAMPLES);

  // Find peak frequency
  double peakFrequency = FFT.majorPeak(vReal, SAMPLES, SAMPLING_FREQUENCY);
  Serial.print("Peak Frequency: ");
  Serial.println(peakFrequency);

  delay(1000);
}
```
